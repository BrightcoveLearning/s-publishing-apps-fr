    <p>Apple requires that iOS/tvOS apps must have a delete button to remove a viewer's account. See Apple's App Store Review Guidelines document, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#5.1.1">Legal - Data Collection and Storage</a> section for full details.</p>

    <p>In the app's <strong>Settings -> My Account</strong> options a <strong>Delete Account</strong> option is present</p>

    <p>When the viewer clicks the button, {{ site.product_short }} performs the following tasks:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Confirms the viewer wishes to delete the account.</li>
      <li>Alerts the viewer that they must cancel all active subscriptions with other platform's stores before {{ site.product_short }} account deletion can occur.</li>
      <li>{{ site.product_short }}'s backend verifies all of the viewer's active subscriptions with other platform's stores that there are no active subscriptions.</li>
      <li>Removal of viewer information from Stripe and Evergent (name, contact info, payment data)</li>
      <li>{{ site.product_short }}'s user management service deletes the account and all associated data associated with that account, like preferences, favorites, recently watched, etc.</li>
      <li>Notifies the user the account is deleted, via a message in an app alert, when all conditions are met and deletion processes completed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note that if a viewer uses an OIDC login and logs in after the account has been removed, an account with those credentials will be created, but it is a new, separate account and no previous data associated with that account is retrieved.</p>
