      You may have an existing Android app, but you need to update it so it will be part of your Brightcove {{ site.product_short }} family of apps. This document leads you through that process. A high-level view of the process is: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Turn on timed publishing (not required, but a recommended best practice) </li>
      <li>Update your app</li>

      Turning on <em>timed publishing</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
      When updating an app to become a Brightcove {{ site.product_short }} app, it is highly likely you will NOT want changes to go live immediately. You most likely will want to make all the changes for the new Brightcove {{ site.product_short }} App, then at a specific time the changes will be pushed live. Android provides a mechanism to do this called <em>timed publishing</em>. The steps below guide you on how to enable timed publishing. For complete details on timed publishing see Google's
      <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9543912?hl=en">Publish an app with timed publishing</a> document.
    </p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
      <li>
        Sign in to the
        <a href="https://play.google.com/apps/publish/">Google Play Console</a>.
      </li>
      <li>Select the app you are updating to a Brightcove {{ site.product_short }} app.</li>
      <li>
        On the left menu, select
        <strong>Store presence > Store listing</strong>.
        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--tip"> You can turn on timed publishing from several pages in this section, including <strong>Store listing</strong> and <strong>Pricing & distribution</strong> </aside>
      </li>
      <li>
        At the bottom of your screen, turn on timed publishing by clicking on the <strong>Timed publishing</strong> switch.
      </li>
      <li>
        Review details in the <strong>Timed publishing</strong> dialog.

        </figure>
      </li>
      <li>Click the <strong>TURN ON</strong> button.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Now, as you make changes you will click the <strong>SUBMIT UPDATE</strong> button and the following dialog will appear:

      <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/s-publishing-apps-img/update-android-to-bcb/sumbit-update.png" alt="submit update" />
    </figure>
    When you close the dialog you will see a list of updates that have been made under timed publishing. When you are ready to publish your updated Brightcove {{ site.product_short }} app, you will click the <strong>Go live</strong> button.
    </p>
    <p>
      You need to decide if you want timed publishing to be active or not when updating the app, described in the following section.
