      You need to use Android Debug Bridge (adb) to connect your computer to an Amazon Fire TV device for installing, testing and debugging your apps.

    <h2 id="installing-firetv">Installing your Brightcove {{ site.product_short }} App</h2>
    <p>
      To install and test your Brightcove {{ site.product_short }} app before submitting it to the Amazon Appstore, you need to use the Android Debug Bridge (adb).
    </p>
    <p>
      Installing your own app (outside of the Appstore) is sometimes referred to as sideloading an app.
    </p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information"> To follow these steps, you must have already used <em>adb</em> to connect your development computer to your Fire TV device.
    </aside>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
      <li>Open your terminal or command line.</li>
      <li>
        Type the following command, where <code translate="No">path-to-apk-file</code> is the file system path to your app's APK.
        <pre class="line-numbers"><code class=“language-bash”>adb install path-to-apk-file</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        If your installation was successful, adb will respond with a message similar to this one:
        <pre class="line-numbers"><code class=“language-bash”> 764 KB/s (217246 bytes in 0.277s)
 pkg: /data/local/tmp/HelloWorld.apk
 Success</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        To re-install an app that already exists on the device, you can use the <code translate="No">-r</code> option to reinstall it.
        <pre class="line-numbers"><code class=“language-bash”> adb install -r path-to-apk-file</code></pre>
