    <h2 id="Tips">Tips</h2>
    <p>Please consider the following tips when performing your validation:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>First pass</strong>: Choose ONE of the platforms and go through the different areas of testing on that platform. Start with <em>Design and Features</em>, then move on to <em>Page Layout and Content</em> and lastly to <em>Monetization Setup</em> testing.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Additional rounds of testing</strong>: As you finish the first pass for each area, move on to other platforms that are available. If an issue is applicable to multiple platforms, please note that in any previously reported tickets.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Testing fixes</strong>: Fixes for reported issues will be in one of these three areas:
        <ul>
          <li>The Brightcove {{ site.product_short }} Experience (no app updates needed)</li>
          <li>In the app(s)</li>
          <li>The Brightcove {{ site.product_short }} backend</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If the fix is in the app, a new build will be provided with details of what was fixed. For other areas, Brightcove would provide details in the ticket on what was fixed. To speed up fixing and retesting, it is very important that the tickets provide details on the issue, and steps to help with retesting.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
